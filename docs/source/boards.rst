	:align: center

|

Download the pre-configured image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to set up a Raspberry Pi board so that it becomes available for Wyliodrin STUDIO is to download an image that is already configured.


Download the image for `Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi 1 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_zero_2019_11_21.zip>`_.


Download the image for `Raspberry Pi 2 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_2019_11_27.zip>`_, `Raspberry Pi 3 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_2019_11_27.zip>`_ and `Raspberry Pi 4 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_2019_11_27.zip>`_.


Once the image downloaded and unziped, the only thing that you have to do is to :ref:`flash <flash>` it. After that, you can simply insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and your board should be visible within Wyliodrin STUDIO.

|

=========================

|

Set up the board manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

However, you can also choose to configure the required image by yourself.

This will imply flashing an image with the OS (Raspbian), installing the STUDIO Supervisor container and setting up some configuration files.

Download the Raspbian image
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You will need to:

1. Download a Raspberry Pi Image
2. Install the Studio Supervisor
3. Setup a provisioning file

Raspbian is provided in two flavors, **Desktop** and **Lite**. The first one is packed with all the desktop user interface and applications while the second one contains only the minimum OS without any applications. The second one is just what we want for Studio, as we will deploy all the applications that want.

Download the `Raspbian Lite <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/>`_ image from the Raspberry Pi foundation. This is the standard OS for the Raspberry Pi provided by the manufacturer.

|

.. _flash:

Flash the image
"""""""""""""""""

The downloaded image needs to be flash (written) to an SD card. The minimum size of the SD card is 4 GB.

.. note::

	We recommend a minimum of 8 GB Class 10 SD Card. For small applications 4 GB might be enough.

To flash the image, you will need a special software. The recommended application is `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_.

.. note::

	For Linux users, you may use the **dd** utility.

|

Install STUDIO Supervisor
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To be able to access the Studio network, the Raspberry Pi needs to run the STUDIO Supervisor software. The following tutorial will explain how to install it.

After writing the SD Card, insert it into the Raspberry Pi and start the Raspberry Pi. You will have to access it. This can be done either by:

* connecting the Raspberry Pi to the network and use a SSH to connect to it (If you are using **Raspberry Pi Zero** and you want to use SSH, you will need an USB-OTG adapter to get connected to the network.)
* connect a monitor and a keyboard to the Raspberry Pi

.. note::

	Using the SSH will require to enable it before. Insert the SD card into your computer. One (or two if Linux) partitions will show up. On the FAT partition (the first one), create and empty file named **ssh**.



**Install Dependencies**
--------------------------

The dependencies you will have to install are:

- *supervisor*: allows you to monitor processes related to a project
- *redis*: database management system
- *build-essential*: reference package for all the packages required for compilation
- *git*: required for the **npm install** command to download git included package
- *python3-pip*: python 3 programming language

.. code-block:: bash
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y supervisor redis build-essential git python3-pip


	# To enable the Notebook tab, you should also run
	sudo pip3 install redis pygments


|

**Install Node.js**
------------------------

The next step is to `install NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_, considering the model of Raspberry Pi that you are using.

For **Pi Zero** and **Pi 1**, you will need the `ARMv6 <https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-armv6l.tar.xz>`_ version of Node.js, so you will run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

	wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-armv6l.tar.xz

	tar xvJf node-v10.16.3-linux-armv6l.tar.xz

	cd node-v10.16.3-linux-armv6l

	sudo cp -R * /usr

	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/node_modules /usr/lib/node

	cd ..

	rm -rf node-v10.16.3-linux-armv6l



For **Pi 2**, **Pi 3** and **Pi 4** models, the `ARMv7  <https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz>`_ version of Node.js is required, meaning that the bash commands are:

.. code-block:: bash

	wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz

	tar xvJf node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz

	cd node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l

	sudo cp -R * /usr

	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/node_modules /usr/lib/node

	cd ..

	rm -rf node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l

|

**Install studio-supervisor**
-------------------------------

In order to install studio-supervisor, the following commands are required:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo su -
	npm install -g --unsafe-perm studio-supervisor

	exit
	sudo mkdir /wyliodrin

|

**Write the supervisor script**
----------------------------------

Using nano editor, write the /etc/supervisor/conf.d/studiosupervisor.conf file with the following contents:

To start the editor, type

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/studio-supervisor.conf

.. code-block:: ini

	[program:studio-supervisor]
	command=/usr/bin/studio-supervisor raspberrypi
	home=/wyliodrin
	user=pi


Press Ctrl+X to save and exit the editor. Press Y when whether to save the file.

After that, you have to make the **/wyliodrin** directory your home directory:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo chown pi:pi /wyliodrin
	cp /home/pi/.bashrc /wyliodrin/.bashrc

The final step is to refresh the board by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

	
	sudo supervisorctl reload

|

=====================

Connecting via web 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connection of a Raspberry Pi board to the web version of Wyliodrin STUDIO demands an Internet connection and the creation of a file, **wyliodrin.json**, that will be written and stored on the SD card. The purpose of this configuration file is to keep a series of particular informations about the device and the platform, so the both instances be able to recognize and communicate with each other.

Acquiring the **wyliodrin.json** file assumes that you will have to launch the web version of the application and to click on the *Connect* button. After selecting the *New Device* option from the popup, a new dialog box will be opened and will ask you for the name of your new device.

|

Once you start typing the name of your device, a JSON structure is automatically generated depending on the entered data. The format of the object consists of the following properties:

.. list-table::

	* - Property title
	  - Description
	* - *token*
	  - unique identifier for the device, automatically assigned by the program
	* - *id*
	  - device name, updated as you change the name in the input box
	* - *server*
	  - endpoint

The content of this JSON structure has to be copied into a file that you will name **wyliodrin.json**, as mentioned before. Once the file created and saved, it has to be stored on the SD card, in the partition called **boot**. This action can be done by inserting the flashed card into your personal computer, which will lead to the automatic opening of the *boot* partition. 

After copying the configuration file to the destination indicated, you can insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect the board to the Internet and power it on. At this step, if you hit the *Connect* button of the web application, you should see your Raspberry Pi device into the list of available devices and by clicking on its name you will be able to connect it to the IDE.

Wyliolab Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/wyliolab.png
	:align: center

If you are using the Wyliolab boards, you can download the pre-configured image for `Pi Zero and Pi 1 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_zero_wyliolab_2019_11_27.zip>`_, or the image for `Pi 2 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_wyliolab_2019_11_27.zip>`_, `Pi 3 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_wyliolab_2019_11_27.zip>`_ and `Pi 4 <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_raspberrypi_wyliolab_2019_11_27.zip>`_.

|

If you choose to continue the manual setup for the Raspberry Pi of the Wyliolab board, you should run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo pip3 install wyliozero

	sudo su -
	npm install -g --unsafe-perm studio-supervisor

	exit
	sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/studio-supervisor.conf

.. code-block:: ini

	[program:studio-supervisor]
	command=/usr/bin/studio-supervisor raspberrypi wyliolab
	home=/wyliodrin
	user=pi

After modifying the content of the *studio-supervisor.conf* file, you will have to run:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo raspi-config

In the prompt that will be opened, you will have to select the fifth option(Interfacing Options), then in the Configuration Tool section you will have to pick *P6 Serial* in order to disable the shell and enable the serial port.

The final step before using the Wyliolab board is to reboot it.

.. image:: images/picopi.png
	:align: center

To configure the Pico-Pi IMX8M board, it will be necessary to flash an image with the Ubuntu operating system, install the Studio-Supervisor container and set up some configuration files.

Download the pre-configured image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to set up a Pico-Pi IMX8M board so that it becomes available for Wyliodrin STUDIO is to download an image that is already configured.


Download the image for `PicoPi IMX8M <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_picopi_imx8m_2019_09_17.zip>`_.


Once the image downloaded and unziped, the only thing that you have to do is to :ref:`flash <flashubuntu>` it. After that, your Pico-Pi board should be visible within Wyliodrin STUDIO.

|

Set up the board manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Enable the USB mass storage device
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The first step is to connect the Pico-Pi device directly to your computer, using the micro USB and USB type C cables.

If your computer is running on **Linux**, you should be able to see the .................

If you are using **Windows**, you will need an additional driver to see the COM ports: 

https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

After downloading and extracting the files, you should open the Device Manager, right click on the Ports section and select the driver. By the end, you should be able to see the following devices:

.. image:: images/devicemanager.png
	:align: center


|

Export the EMMC device as mass storage to the host computer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**1. Set up the serial terminal**

As the Pico-Pi is already directly connected to your computer, you have to get a serial terminal program running. For Linux, we suggest you to use **screen**, but any other serial terminal should work.

If you are using Windows, we recommend you to download and open `Putty <https://www.putty.org/>`_ and customize the session with the following options:

.. list-table::

	* - Connection type
	  - Serial
	* - Serial line
	  - COM port for Pico-Pi, in this example COM9
	* - Speed
	  - 115200

Once the session started, it will load U-boot and you will be able to see the text "Hit any key to stop autoboot:". Pressing on a key will stop the boot process and a open a boot prompt.

.. note::

	If the boot prompt doesn't appear, you should reboot the board by pressing the Restart button.

|

**2. List the accessible devices**

In order to get a list with the MMC devices, you should run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	mmc list

The output should look like this:


|

**3. Export the EMMC device**

To export the Pico-Pi device to the host computer, you will run the next command:

.. code-block:: bash

	ums 0 mmc 0

The output will be:

.. code-block:: bash

	UMS: LUN 0, dev 1, hwpart 0, sector 0x0, count 0xe90000
	/

A rotating cursor will be visible while the USB Mass Storage is running and the boot prompt can be exited by pressing CTRL+C.

If you followed this steps, a new USB device should appear on your PC and you will use it to load the Ubuntu image.

.. Download the pre-configured image
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. The easiest way to set up a Udoo Neo board so that it becomes available for Wyliodrin STUDIO is to download an image that is already configured.


.. Download the image for `Udoo Neo <https://wyliodrin-studio.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wyliodrin_studio_beaglebone_black_2019_09_17.zip>`_.



.. Once the image downloaded and unziped, the only thing that you have to do is to :ref:`flash <flashUdoo>` it. After that, you can simply insert the SD card into the Udoo Neo and your board should be visible within Wyliodrin STUDIO.

.. |

|

Set up the board manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can choose to configure the required image by yourself.

This will imply flashing an image with the OS (Ubuntu), installing the STUDIO Supervisor container and setting up some configuration files.

Download the Ubuntu image
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

You will need to:

1. Download a Ubuntu Image
2. Install the Studio Supervisor
3. Setup a provisioning file


Download the `Ubuntu 16 <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BkJCJrtGcZWHHQtXeOLIWPspK3jqwiBZ/view>`_ image for Udoo Neo.

|

.. _flashUdoo:

Flash the image
"""""""""""""""""

The downloaded image needs to be flash (written) to an SD card. The minimum size of the SD card is 4 GB.

.. note::

	We recommend a minimum of 8 GB Class 10 SD Card. For small applications 4 GB might be enough.

To flash the image, you will need a special software. The recommended application is `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_.

.. note::

	For Linux users, you may use the **dd** utility.

|

Install STUDIO Supervisor
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To be able to access the Studio network, the Udoo Neo needs to run the STUDIO Supervisor software. The following tutorial will explain how to install it.

After writing the SD Card, insert it into the board and start the device. You will have to access it. This can be done either by:

* connecting the Udoo Neo to the network and use a SSH to connect to it 
* connect a monitor and a keyboard to the board

If you are using SSH, you will have to input 192.168.7.2 as the host IP address and then login with the appropriate credentials:

username: *udooer*

password: *udooer*


**Install Dependencies**
--------------------------

The dependencies you will have to install are:

- *supervisor*: allows you to monitor processes related to a project
- *redis*: database management system
- *build-essential*: reference package for all the packages required for compilation
- *git*: required for the **npm install** command to download git included package
- *python3-pip*: python 3 programming language

.. code-block:: bash
	
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y supervisor redis-server build-essential git python3-pip


	# To enable the Notebook tab, you should also run
	sudo pip3 install redis pygments

|

**Install Node.js**
------------------------

The next step is to `install NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_.

For Udoo Neo, the `ARMv7  <https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz>`_ version of Node.js is required, meaning that the bash commands are:

.. code-block:: bash

	wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz

	tar xvJf node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l.tar.xz


After installing and unziping Node, you should reboot the board and restart the session and remove old node:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo rm /usr/bin/npm
	sudo rm /usr/bin/npx
	sudo rm /usr/lib/node_modules


Continue the configuration by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

	cd node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l

	sudo cp -R * /usr

	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/node_modules /usr/lib/node

	cd ..

	rm -rf node-v10.16.3-linux-armv7l

|

**Install studio-supervisor**
-------------------------------

In order to install studio-supervisor, the following commands are required:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo su -
	npm install -g --unsafe-perm studio-supervisor

	exit
	sudo mkdir /wyliodrin

|

**Write the supervisor script**
----------------------------------

Using nano editor, write the /etc/supervisor/conf.d/studiosupervisor.conf file with the following contents:

To start the editor, type

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/studio-supervisor.conf

.. code-block:: ini

	[program:studio-supervisor]
	command=/usr/bin/studio-supervisor udooneo
	home=/wyliodrin
	user=udooer


Press Ctrl+X to save and exit the editor. Press Y when whether to save the file.

After that, you have to make the **/wyliodrin** directory your home directory:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo chown udooer:udooer /wyliodrin
	cp /home/udooer/.bashrc /wyliodrin/.bashrc

The final step is to refresh the board by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

	
	sudo supervisorctl reload

|

Connecting via web 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connection of a Udoo Neo board to the web version of Wyliodrin STUDIO demands an Internet connection and the creation of a file, **wyliodrin.json**, that will be written and stored on the SD card. The purpose of this configuration file is to keep a series of particular informations about the device and the platform, so the both instances be able to recognize and communicate with each other.

Acquiring the **wyliodrin.json** file assumes that you will have to launch the web version of the application and to click on the *Connect* button. After selecting the *New Device* option from the popup, a new dialog box will be opened and will ask you for the name of your new device.

|

Once you start typing the name of your device, a JSON structure is automatically generated depending on the entered data. The format of the object consists of the following properties:

.. list-table::

	* - Property title
	  - Description
	* - *token*
	  - unique identifier for the device, automatically assigned by the program
	* - *id*
	  - device name, updated as you change the name in the input box
	* - *server*
	  - endpoint

The content of this JSON structure has to be copied into a file that you will name **wyliodrin.json**, as mentioned before. 

To add this file, you will have to connect the device to Wyliodrin STUDIO, open the **Shell** tab and run:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo nano /boot/wyliodrin.json


After creating the configuration file to the destination indicated, you can hit the *Connect* button of the web application. At this point, you should see your Udoo Neo device into the list of available devices and by clicking on its name you will be able to connect it to the IDE.

**Install and configure Micropython**
=====================================

1. Install and configure Micropython on Windows
-----------------------------------------------

1.1 Download Micropython firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a browser and type this link: https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/,
then go install the latest version (without opening it). 

*Suggestion*: create a folder on your computer named “esp8266” or “micropython” and download it there.

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_firmware.png
	:align: center


1.2 Install NodeMCU PyFlasher and flashing Micropython on ESP8266
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NodeMCU PyFlasher is a new GUI tool to flash NodeMCU based on esptool.py and wxPython. It is available for Windows and for macOS.
First, you have to connect the ESP8266 to your computer. Take the USB cable from the kit and Put the USB-C in one of your ports and then connect the micro-USB to the microcontroller.

Check this link `install NodeMCU <https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher/releases>`_, scroll down to the executables. If f you have Windows 10 choose the first one (*NodeMCU-PyFlasher-4.0-x64.exe*), if you have Windows 7 choose the second one (*NodeMCU-PyFlasher-4.0-x86.exe*).

After the installation will be completed, click on the NodeMCU PyFlasher .exe file and you should have a similar window:

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_nodeMCU_windows1.png
	:align: center

First, you have to choose your serial port, in this case it is “COM4”, (the number after “COM” is based on the port that you chose) like in the image below. 

If you want to check which port you chose go in the Open Start menu and type “Device Manager”, then check Ports section (the number after “COM” is based on the port that you chose).

Succeeding, you have to click on “Browse” and go to the folder where you installed Micropython and choose the .bin file. Next you should chose the “Baud rate” like in the image below:

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_nodeMCU_windows2.png
	:align: center

If you encounter errors, you need to reduce the baud rate (for example 9600 or up down). “1115200” is the speed read by serial port

As final step, you have to click on the button “Flash NodeMCU”.

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_nodeMCU_windows3.png
	:align: center

**Congratulations**, now you have Micropython on your ESP8266!


2.Install and configure Micropython on Linux
---------------------------------------------

2.1 Install Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you should check if you have python3 installed. For that open Terminal and type: 
	
	**$ python3 --version**

If the python version appears, you can skip the installation go to Verify PIP is installed. You might have a newer version of python

If you do not have python installed, you have to use this command:

	**$ sudo apt install python3**

At the moment, you should have python3. In order to check if the installation is completed, type: 

	**$ python3** 

Then try to code in python, like in the image below:

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_linux_1.png
	:align: center

*To exit python press Ctrl+Z.*

Verify PIP is installed

Open Terminal and type :
	
	**$ pip3**

If it is installed you should have a similar output :

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_linux_2.png
	:align: center

But if it has not been installed, you have to use the commands:
 
	**$ sudo apt-get update**

	**$ sudo apt-get install python-pip**

	**$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip**

**Congratulations**, now you have installed Python!

2.2 Download Micropython firmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a browser and type this link: https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/,
then go install the latest version (without opening it). 

*Suggestion*: create a folder on your computer named “esp8266” or “micropython” and download it there.

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_firmware.png
	:align: center


2.3 Flashing Micropython on ESP8266
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open Terminal and use the command:
 
 **$ pip3 install esptool**

Then check the esptool installation by typing:

	**$ esptool**

Connect the ESP8266 to your computer. Take the USB cable from the kit and Put the USB-C in one of your ports and then connect the micro-USB to the microcontroller.

Succeeding, go to the folder where you installed Micropython firmware. Use **$ls** command to list files and directories and **$ cd** to change the current working directory.

Type **$ dmesg** to see the port, you should have a similar output:

.. image:: images/micropython/mp_linux_3_dmesg.png
	:align: center

In this case the port is *ttyUSB0*.

After, use the command:

	**$ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash**

for erasing the flash memory on the board. Instead of *ttyUSB0* you might have another port. You have to put the one that you have seen earlier.

Press the reset (RST) button from your ESP8266, then use the command: 

	**$ esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 esp8266-20170108-v1.8.7.bin**

Keep in mind to put the port that you used in the previous command and pay attention to the version of Micropython that you have installed. Instead of *“esp8266-20170108-v1.8.7.bin”* you might have another version. You must replace it in the command. If you encounter errors, you need to reduce the baud rate (for example 115200 or up down).

Next, connect to the serial console with command:

	**$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200**

“115200” is the speed read by serial port. To close it type **Ctrl+D** or **Ctrl+a** followed by **Ctrl+\\**.

**Congratulations**, now you have Micropython on your ESP8266!
